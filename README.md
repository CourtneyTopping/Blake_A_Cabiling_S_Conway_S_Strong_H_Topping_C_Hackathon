# ThermoSecure™ by HouseCom™
This is the hackathon midterm project for Fanshawe College. In groups of 5, we were to create an interactive application using 3D, video, and still images. Using design and developing skills, we must produce an engaging experience for the end user which they can interact in a one-page website. The product that must be used for this midterm is the ThermoSecure™ by HouseCom™. It is a fully digital, hardwired, and wireless enabled home personal and secure environment control system.
